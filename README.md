Our Image Analysis Platform is a sophisticated web application designed to revolutionize the process of identifying objects or anomalies from images using a deep learning pipeline. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, our platform offers users a seamless experience in training and accessing models for image analysis.

**Goal:**

Our primary goal is to demonstrate how users can train their custom object detection models efficiently using Extract. By simplifying the model training process and providing easy access to trained models, we aim to empower users to harness the power of deep learning for their specific needs.

**Functionality:**

**Extract offers the following key functionalities:**

**Model Management:** Users can create and manage their custom object detection models within the platform.

**Image Annotation:** The platform provides intuitive tools for tagging images, ensuring accurate training data preparation.

**Model Training:** Users can initiate model training with just a few clicks, selecting options to start from scratch or continue from where they left off.

**Model Inference:** Once trained, models are ready to use for inference. Users can upload images and run inference to detect objects with their trained models.

**How to Use:**

**To utilize Extract for training your custom model, follow these steps:**

**Registration:** Begin by registering yourself on Extract by providing your first name, last name, and email. Create your account to access the platform.

**Log In:** Log in to your account using your credentials.

**Dashboard:** Upon logging in, you'll be greeted with the Extract dashboard, which provides information about your models, cluster workload, training process status, and plan details.

**Project Creation:** Create a project for your model by giving it a name.

**Model Creation:** Within your project, create a model and specify the object labels you want to detect.

**Image Upload:** Add images to your project and tag them by drawing bounding boxes around the objects of interest.

**Model Training:** Start the training process for your model, selecting options to start from scratch or continue from where you left off.

**Model Inference:** Once training is complete, your model is ready to use for inference. Upload images to detect objects with your trained model.
